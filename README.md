# Model-Advantage and Value-Aware Models for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Bridging the Gap in Theory and Practice

This repository contains the code for the paper [Model-Advantage and Value-Aware Models for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning: Bridging the Gap in Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14080). This repository has two submodules that correspond to the code for the SLBO and MBPO experiments in the paper.

### Part A: [VA-SLBO Repository](https://github.com/nirbhayjm/va_mbpo)

### Part B: [VA-MBPO Repository](https://github.com/nirbhayjm/va_mbpo)
